## Part 1 | PrizmDoctor: Doctor Who

[PrizmDoctor: Doctor Who](https://git.jpg.com/support/PrizmDoctor) gathers all of the logs and configuration files related to the PrizmDoc installation

## Part 2 | PrizmDoctor: Doc Brown

[PrizmDoctor: Doc Brown](https://git.jpg.com/support/PrizmDoctor) will analyze those log and config files to determine potential issues with an installation. In this portion of the project, a module system will be implemented to make the application pluggable in order to easily analyze different schemas as well as any other options that might change over time.

## Part 3 | PrizmDoctor: Doc TBD

[PrizmDoctor: Doc TBD](https://git.jpg.com/support/PrizmDoctor) will take that formatted analysis output and create a report of those issues and find potential solutions from FAQ's, documentation, internal files, etc that map problems to a recommended solution.

## Part 4 | PrizmDoctor: Doc TBD

[PrizmDoctor: Doc TBD](https://git.jpg.com/support/PrizmDoctor) could be importing that report into the UI and giving the support user, or eventually a customer, a set of options in the form of buttons and checkboxes that correspond to different scripts that would try to remedy individual issues.
